an online web-app for having your To-Do List, I did this project for learning django, is running on a free render server, wanna try it? take a look.

# Before clicking on it, you need to know:
1. it is not finished yet, so probably you will find some weird text like a Lorem ipsum text in some pages, sorry in advance 😅
2. it takes some time loading it, please be patience, it is running on a free server, I don't have money for more powerfull one, sorry again in advance 👍

# What can I do ?

• Create Tasks

• Read Tasks

• Update Tasks

• Delete Tasks

I think you figured out, yes, it is a CRUD web-app, so basically you can create, delete, edit and update the status of the tasks you have done in your day.
